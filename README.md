## About
This game was created in middle school as my final year project. It was originally not meant to be more than just a school project, so the documentation is written for non-programmers and only in slovak language. The mechanisms of the program are very simple and often ineffective, many of which I would have done completely different if I were to rewrite it. But I feel like having older projects in their original form highlights my progress as a software engineer seen on some of my newer work. This was also the first major project I have ever finished. I plan on updating the "documentation" in the future, or at least translate it to English. Although I feel like it would be a waste of time to document such a project, so maybe a short tour of my code would be in better suited. 

The program was compiled into an executable and thanks to my lack of knowledge at the time, I had to compile it from a single file. That's why the original version has all the code in a single .py file. It can still be viewed in the "original" folder.
